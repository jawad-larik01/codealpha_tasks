# codealpha_tasks

Welcome to codealpha_tasks! This repository is a collection of Python projects and scripts designed to showcase various programming skills and practical applications. It includes three main tasks:

1. Hangman Game: A classic word-guessing game implemented in Python. Players have six attempts to guess the hidden word, with visual feedback on their progress and remaining attempts.

2. ChatBot: A simple yet interactive chatbot built using the NLTK library. It can greet users, answer basic questions, tell jokes, and handle common conversational prompts. The chatbot is designed to be user-friendly and easily extendable.

3. File Organizer: A utility script that organizes files in a specified directory into categorized folders based on file types (e.g., Images, Documents, Videos). This tool helps keep your directories clean and well-structured.

Each project is well-documented and easy to run, making it a great resource for learning Python, exploring basic AI concepts, or managing files efficiently. Feel free to explore, contribute, or use these scripts in your own projects!
